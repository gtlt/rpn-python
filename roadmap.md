# Backlog

## For the calculator
 - review current code (see [todo.md](todo.md))
 - add more maths operators to the calculator
 - allow cancelling last operation(=operator) => needs an intermediate state in the calculator
 - allow evaluation of full maths expression

## In the API
 - replace client instance by ip with Websocket or redis (to have a time to leave on the instance for example)

## CI/CD
 - make a Dockerfile
 - etc.
