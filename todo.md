# TODO:
 - add tests for all calculator methods
 - add tests for api
 - check that all error cases are implemented (e.g:remove_last onn empty, divide zero)
 - check variables naming
 - maybe return elements on post/delete call for a better usability

# Shortcuts made
 - identify client instance by ip
 - all errors are ValueError => to review/define own errors
 - only partially TDD made
